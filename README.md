# TMDb Movie Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset containing information about 10,000 movies collected from **The Movie Database (TMDb)**. The goal is to explore trends in movie revenue, genre popularity, and other key factors like budget, vote average, and runtime. We use **Pandas** for data manipulation, **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization, and **NumPy** for numerical operations.

By the end of the analysis, we aim to answer questions like:
- What genres tend to generate the highest revenue?
- How does budget influence revenue?
- What are the trends in movie revenues over time?

## How to Run the Notebook
To replicate the analysis and view the results, follow these steps:

1. **Download the repository** by clicking the "Code" button on the GitHub page and choosing "Download ZIP."
2. **Open the notebook** in your preferred environment (Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook).
   - To open in **Google Colab**, use the link provided below, or upload the `.ipynb` file directly to Colab.
   - In **Jupyter Notebook**, open the `.ipynb` file from your local environment.
3. **Run all the cells** to perform the analysis and generate visualizations. The notebook is interactive and will guide you through each step.

## Required Libraries
This notebook uses the following Python libraries for data analysis and visualization:

- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting and visualization
